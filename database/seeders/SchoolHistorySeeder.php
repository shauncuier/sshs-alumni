 * The school-history timeline.

 * Two verified milestones are seeded and the timeline is left open for the
 * committee to extend without limit.
 *
 * Seeding BOTH founding years is what keeps the story honest: the fifty years
 * belong to the school (1976), and the association (2015) is the body
 * organising the celebration. A timeline showing only 1976 would imply the
 * association is fifty years old, which it is not.
